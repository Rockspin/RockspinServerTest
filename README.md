# RockspinServerTest

## basic outline
Create an address book application that records users and their phone numbers. It does not require complex features 
like contact photos or contact maching. It should simply store usernames and phone numbers, include any verification
or business logic that you think is a basic requirement of an address book. 

The application must:
- Be written using the ninja framework. (http://www.ninjaframework.org)
- Use a postgres database as the datastore. (https://www.postgresql.org)
- Must use hibernate to interface with this database. (http://hibernate.org) 
- The application should be updated using a JSON rest API, with appropiate methods. 
- Feature whatever tests you feel are neccessary.

Host the application on heroku (www.heoroku.com) and share the url once it has been created.
